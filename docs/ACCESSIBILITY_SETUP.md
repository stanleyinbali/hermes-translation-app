### ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **System Settings Opens** automatically to:
   ```
   Privacy & Security > Accessibility
   ```

2. **Look for "HermesApp" in the list**
   - Scroll through the list of apps
   - Find "HermesApp" (or just "Hermes")
   - It may appear with the Hermes icon

3. **Enable the Checkbox**
   - Click the checkbox next to "HermesApp" to turn it **ON**
   - The checkbox should show a checkmark ✓
   
4. **You may need to unlock first**
   - Click the 🔒 lock icon at the bottom left
   - Enter your Mac password
   - Now you can check the HermesApp box

5. **Restart Hermes**
   - Quit Hermes completely (right-click menu bar icon → Quit)
   - Relaunch the app
   - The Cmd+C+C shortcut will now work!

### 📋 What This Permission Does

**Accessibility Permission** allows Hermes to:
- ✅ Monitor the Cmd+C+C keyboard shortcut globally
- ✅ Read selected text from any application
- ✅ Capture text without using the clipboard

Without this permission:
- ❌ Cmd+C+C shortcut won't work
- ❌ Can't detect when you want to translate
- ❌ App can only translate text you manually paste

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

**"I don't see HermesApp in the list"**
1. Make sure the app is running (check menu bar)
2. Try the "Grant Permission" button again
3. Look for variations: "HermesApp", "Hermes", or "com.hermes.HermesApp"
4. Scroll to the bottom - newly installed apps appear at the end

**"The checkbox is grayed out"**
1. Click the 🔒 lock icon at bottom left
2. Enter your Mac password to unlock
3. Now you can toggle the checkbox

**"I enabled it but it still doesn't work"**
1. Make sure the checkbox has a ✓ checkmark
2. **Restart Hermes** (Quit and relaunch)
3. Try the Cmd+C+C shortcut again

### 📸 Visual Example

In System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility, you should see:

```
☐ App Store
☐ Calendar
☐ Chrome
☑ HermesApp          ← Check this box!
☐ Mail
☐ Messages
```

The checkbox must be **checked (☑)** for Hermes to work.

### ⚡ Quick Test

After enabling:
1. Open any app (Safari, Notes, etc.)
2. Select some text: "Hello, how are you?"
3. Press **Cmd+C+C** (double-tap)
4. Translation should appear!

If it works, you're all set! 🎉
